<h1>My Coaching:</h1>
<h2>What we do:</h2>
<p>This is a personal coaching service that allows you to have affordable advice from a range of topics.</p>
<p>I can speak to you about any particular subjects about the gym ranging from:
<ul>Exercise performance (form),</ul>
<ul>Exercise selection and programming,</ul>
<ul>Diet (Variet, Weight Gain, Weight Loss, Macros, Recipes),</ul>
<ul>Life advice with training,</ul>
<ul>Any other tips or advice you need. </ul>

<p>I will try my best to give a well researched, nuanced response. This can be great if you need a quick clarification. If you become a regular to this service, I can use our context to create a more detailed, personalised experience. </p>
<p>My main goal of this service is to be as accessible as possible and to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>To be transparent - there is plenty of information online that you can find that is applicable and can get you as far as you would need. This service is meant to fill-in gaps and provide cohesive and personalied information. I have a list of great people to listen to here:.</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I am a first year computer science student at university with an astute interest in weightlifting.</p>
<p>I have been training for nearly 7 years and a lot of information to give. Mostly built from many past mistakes!</p>
<p>Basing my training style from pragmaticism and science, I try to help my friends and family in all things gym. I have personally coached people and would like to do this for as many people as I can as I truly love it. </p>

<h2>How to get into contact:</h2>
